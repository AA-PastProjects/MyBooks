This project was developed as one of the first I made after I had learned the basics of programming.

I made it in collaboration with 2 classmates. I have learned much since that time about good code practice and reusabiliy of code and such.

Nonetheless I still like how the project turned out as a whole and therefore show it.

If you download the project and run it via Netbeans, you can use the following users:
