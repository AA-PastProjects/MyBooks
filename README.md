This project was developed as one of the first I made after I had learned the basics of programming.

I made it in collaboration with 2 classmates. I have learned much since that time about good code practice and reusabiliy of code and such. Nonetheless I still like how the project turned out as a whole and therefore show it.

If you download the project and run it via Netbeans, you can use the following users:

### User

Username: Alex

Password: Alex1

### Admin

Username: superAdmin

Password: superAdmin

Remember to tick the "Login as admin" box in the login screen.
